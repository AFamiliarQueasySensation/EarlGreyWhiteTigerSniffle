Image Down Scale with Java

How to Use
======================
0. Upload to Eclipse
1. Place files you want to use in the root directory (example images are in root)
2. Run ==> Run Configurations ==> Project (A4),  Main Class (Gui) ==> Arguments ==> Program Arguments (type file name (ex. uwo.jpg)) ==> apply ==> run


I only made two files to be honnest.
